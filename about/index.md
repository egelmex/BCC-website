## About ##

BarCamp Canterbury is an *unconference* that is a completely *free* to attend and based loosely around the theme of *technology*.

As an unconference, the content of BarCamp Canterbury is provided by you, the attendees!  Meet with like-minded people, share your ideas and engage in discussions. Do you have a topic you’d like to present? Sign up on the day to give a talk.

This year’s BarCamp Canterbury promises to be bigger and better than before. There will be a hackspace, social area for chilling out, and several rooms for people to give presentations and host discussions.

BarCamp Canterbury is what you make of it…

This year’s event follows successful BarCamp Canterbury events in 2011 and 2012, which welcomed over 150 delegates from all around the UK (and further afield).
